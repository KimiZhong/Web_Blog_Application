Web_Blog_Application
====================

This is a simple web blog application built on Ruby on Rails framework.

There are two types of users: the blog administrator and the blog users.

The blog administrator can enter new postings and comments (typically in reverse 
chronological order), and modify/remove any posting or comment. 

Users can visit the blog site and enter comments on particular postings, but 
cannot modify postings or other users' comments.

This web blog application is built based on the Client-Server architecture, the 
Model-View-Controller model, and the Active Record Dsign Pattern associated with
SQLite Database to store persistent blog data.
